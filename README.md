# 🧃 Vending Machine Program – Final Project for Programming Concept
This repository contains our **University Final Project** for the **Programming Concept** course, developed by a group of three students using **Java** in **Visual Studio Code**.

### 📌 Project Overview
We built a **console-based Vending Machine application** that allows users to:
- 💰 Insert money
- 🍽️ Choose from a list of drinks or food
- ❌ Get notified if the balance is insufficient
- ✅ Successfully purchase an item if the balance is enough
- 🔁 Continue purchasing until funds are depleted or the program ends

### 💻 Technologies Used
- Java
- Visual Studio Code

### 🧪 How It Works
1. User inputs an amount of money.
2. Program displays available items with their prices.
3. User selects an item.
4. The program:
  - Checks if the balance is sufficient
  - Proceeds with the purchase or displays an error
  - Loops for the next action

### 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open it in Visual Studio Code or any Java IDE
3. Compile and run the Project3.java
